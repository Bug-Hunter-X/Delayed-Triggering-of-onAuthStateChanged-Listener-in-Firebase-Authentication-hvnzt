# Delayed Triggering of onAuthStateChanged Listener in Firebase Authentication

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, issue with Firebase Authentication's `onAuthStateChanged` listener.  The listener sometimes experiences a delay in triggering after a successful user login or registration, leading to inconsistencies in the application's state.

The `delayedAuth.js` file shows an example of how this delay can cause problems. The `delayedAuthSolution.js` file provides a solution to mitigate this issue.

## Problem

The `onAuthStateChanged` listener is intended to provide an up-to-date representation of the user's authentication status. However, in certain situations, there is a noticeable delay between the completion of a successful login/registration and the triggering of the listener.  This delay can manifest unpredictably, making it difficult to debug.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing an asynchronous function to handle the authentication process and ensuring that dependent application logic is executed only after the user's authentication status is confirmed.
