The solution involves using async/await to properly handle the asynchronous nature of Firebase authentication. This ensures that the application's logic is executed only after the authentication process is fully complete and `onAuthStateChanged` has reported the correct user status.

```javascript
import { getAuth, onAuthStateChanged, signInWithEmailAndPassword } from "firebase/auth";

async function loginAndProceed(email, password) {
  const auth = getAuth();
  try {
    await signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);
    // Wait for onAuthStateChanged to update
    await new Promise(resolve => {
      const unsubscribe = onAuthStateChanged(auth, user => {
        if (user) {
          unsubscribe();
          resolve();
        }
      });
    });
    // Proceed with application logic that depends on user authentication
    console.log('User logged in and ready!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Login failed:', error);
  }
}
```
